This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in C programming: shadowing variables. The `bug.c` file contains code that exhibits this issue, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.  The bug arises from declaring a variable with the same name within nested scopes. This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult.  The solution clarifies variable scoping to avoid ambiguity.
